Enter Ghost.

MARCELLUS 
Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again.
BARNARDO 
In the same figure like the King that’s dead.
MARCELLUS, to Horatio 
Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
BARNARDO 
Looks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO 
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
BARNARDO 
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS  Speak to it, Horatio.
HORATIO 
What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,
speak.
MARCELLUS 
It is offended.
BARNARDO  See, it stalks away.
HORATIO 
Stay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak!
Ghost exits.
